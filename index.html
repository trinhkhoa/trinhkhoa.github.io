GitHub allows you to store all the files and code for your website in a repository. You can then use GitHub Pages to generate a personal URL and share your site with friends, family, and the world! \n\nFor this tutorial, you need a GitHub account and basic HTML knowledge. You don&apos;t need to know Git or the command line. (But if you do want to learn how to use these tools, check out our [Learn Git &amp; GitHub](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) and [Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) courses.)\n\n## GitHub vs. GitHub Pages\n\nIn GitHub, code is stored in a _repository_, or repo. You can think of it as a special folder that lives online. GitHub hosts that folder so that it is accessible to you and your teammates from anywhere in the world. \n\nIn our case, our repository will contain HTML and CSS code that defines a website. But you can&apos;t SEE the website anywhere. GitHub just displays the code like any other text. GitHub Pages essentially connects your repository to a unique URL so that, when you go to that URL – say `username.github.io` – in your browser, you&apos;ll find your website displayed.\n\n## Create a Repository\nLet&apos;s get started!\n\n[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new) named `username.github.io`, where `username` is your GitHub username.\n\n![Screenshot of the create a new repository page](https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/create-a-new-repository.png)\n\nYou have the option here to use a template, add a description, make your repository private, and initialize some additional files. These items make it easy for other developers to learn about your repository: what it&apos;s about, who can access it, who can use the code, etc. For simplicity, we&apos;re going to skip those items for now. Your site will work without them.\n\nClick &quot;Create Repository&quot;.\n\n## Creating Your First Page\n\nYou should be redirected to the repository page, which shows an empty repository. It&apos;s time to add a file! On that page, click the &quot;creating a new file&quot; link. \n\n![Screenshot of the repository page with a rectangle around the creating a new file link](https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/creating-a-new-file-link.png)\n\nName your file **index.html**. Now copy and paste the following code into the file.\n\n```html\n&lt;html&gt;\n\n&lt;body&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;YOUR NAME&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my website!&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;img src=&quot;https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n```\n\nYou can customize the text that says `YOUR NAME` and `Welcome to my website!`. \n\n![Screenshot of the create index.html page after everything is filled out](https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/commit-index-html.png)\n\nChanges to your repository are called _commits_. You can imagine each commit as a snapshot of your repository at different times. \n\nTime to create our first commit! In the first textbox, name your commit &quot;Create index.html&quot;. Commits usually start with a verb describing changes made to the repository.\n\nPress the &quot;Commit new file&quot; button.\n\n## Viewing Your Website\n\nYour website is now accessible at `https://username.github.io`! (Remember to replace `username` with your GitHub username.)\n\n![An animated gif of the website you created](https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/deployed-website.gif)\n\nIf you&apos;d like, you can develop your website by adding more HTML and CSS! Your site should update a few minutes after each commit.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf your site isn&apos;t appearing after 10 minutes, try these additional steps:\n\n1. Within your `username.github.io` repo, go to Settings and scroll down to GitHub Pages. Under Source, make sure that your repo is linked to your web page. If you see `None`, then select the `main` branch.\n\n2. Within the same GitHub Pages section, go to Theme Chooser and select any theme.\n\n![Repo Settings, GitHub Pages section](https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Paths/front-end-career-path/github-pages/github-pages-settings-ii.png)\n","wordCount":578,"author":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Codecademy","sameAs":"https://www.codecademy.com/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Codecademy","sameAs":"https://www.codecademy.com/"}}</script><link href="https://www.codecademy.com/favicon.ico" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon"/><link href="/blog.rss" rel="alternate" title="Codecademy Blog" type="application/rss+xml"/><link rel="canonical" href="https://www.codecademy.com/article/creating-a-website-on-github-pages"/><meta content="Put your work online using GitHub Pages – no command line required!
